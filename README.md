# classrooms

With repl.it's Classrooms feature being disabled on the 31st Jan 2021, schools are now required to pay $1000 dollars a year for something which they used to use for free!

This is a replacement for repl.it's classrooms feature now that it has been shut down.

Teachers can create classrooms  with the `Create` button on the landing page after logging in with repl auth (to be a teacher you must have the teacher role on repl.it (add it [here](https://repl.it/account))
